# Lesson 1: JSON Basics

Welcome to **Lesson 1: JSON Basics** in the JavaScript Series! This lesson focuses on mastering JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data format widely used in web development. By the end of this lesson, you'll be comfortable loading, parsing, filtering, sorting, and manipulating JSON data using JavaScript.

This lesson includes:
- A main `index.html` file where you can experiment with JSON concepts.
- An `exercise/` folder with hands-on tasks to practice real-world scenarios, each with its own starter code and solution.

## **What You'll Learn**
In this lesson, you'll tackle the following topics:
1. Loading and Parsing JSON Data
2. Accessing Specific Fields in JSON Objects
3. Looping Through JSON Arrays
4. Filtering JSON Data Based on Conditions
5. Sorting JSON Data
6. Adding New Fields to JSON Objects
7. Saving Modified JSON Data Back to a File

## **How It Works**
1. **Experiment**: Open `index.html` in your browser and modify `app.js` to test your understanding of JSON concepts.
2. **Exercises**: Each exercise has its own `.js` file (e.g., `ex1.js`) with a specific task. Complete the task, then check your work against the corresponding `sol1.js` file.
3. **Sample JSON Data**: Use the provided `data.json` file or generate your own from [Fake User Generator](https://www.mayoyo.site/fake-user-generator).
